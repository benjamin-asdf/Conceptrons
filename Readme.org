* The Conceptron

The conceptron is a hypothetical formalism with the goal of modeling a rich set of essential, computational properties
of human cerebral cortex implemenents and it's nuclei.

In the spirit and fasion of Hebbs /Cell Assemblies/ [[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebbian_theory][Hebbian theory]], Braitenberg 1977[fn:1]]. This is an attempt at finding a
level up from the neurons, trying to see the forest instead of the trees so to speak.

The goal is to find and describe a computational substrate, or building blocks. The goal is not a detailed model of
biological neuronal nets, each element is idealized and abstracted, but should be evolutionarily plausible.
