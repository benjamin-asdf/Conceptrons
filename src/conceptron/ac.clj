;; attenuation
;; ----------------
;;
;; This is a 'excitability' concept on the sub-neuronal-area level.
;; (I like to flip the concept of threshold to excitability).
;; In the simplest case this says that if I was active recently I am less eager to be active again.
;; Or to say it the other way around 'fresh' neurons have a high excitability.
;;
;; If you have a thought pump increasing and decreasing threshold
;; It is interesting to implement attenuation,
;; If I was active in the recent past, I am less eager to be active again.
;; This makes thought sequences, biasing towards jumping between cell assemblies.
;; In the limit you sort of see the activation flowing around, never staying.
;;
;;
;; From considering this I thought it would make sense that language-cortex (wernicke?) has a high
;; attenuation, this way you get a succesion flow of language.
;; The other way around in a vision area, since objects just stay around.
;; A single enduring idea is useless in the realm of language, but useful in the realm of vision.
;;
;; This is similar to G. Palms 'prediction areas' and 'completion areas'
;; Millers 'plan' and 'image'
;;
;; We can implement this by keeping around the activation states a little, then apply attenuation
;; as a malus to the synaptic input. (The more I was active recently, the less eager I am for more activation)
;;

;; The malus can be applied:

;; - substractive
;; - divisive (like this). (thining absolutely with changing inputs is harder)
;;
;;
;; The malus can be determined:
;;
;; - sum (like this)
;; - weighted sum (for instance 'more recent, more attentuation')
;; - ..
;;
;; You can also decide that the malus is somehow %-wise of the current inputs
;; Becuase with the plasticity we always have to keep in mind that inputs are

;; attenuation-malus
;; More than 1: The first time you are active, you immediately are less eager.
;; 0.5: You actually get more eager after being active once, even after 2 and less eager after 3
;; This is biologically intuitively a bit strange. But interesting to consider.
;; Since biological neural nets are messy with modulators comming and so forth; This might model
;; something happening.
;; Exactly 1.0: If you have 1 neuron timestep in the history, it doesn't matter. Half the synaptic input
;; after 2 times in the hist and so forth.
;;
;; The answer would be somewhere in biological literature. But I am an engineer.
;; I'll just say that attenuation-hist-n is something like 10 and factor is something like 1.1
